# Performance estimation

To estimate the execution time of our pipeline, we computed the total time required to complete all tasks from the directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the workflow. Each task correspond to a simulation step, with dependencies defining execution order.

The detailed results are presented in the following chapters. As a rule of thumb, you can estimate the total number of days required using:

`````{tab} FEP

```{math}
:label: fep_estimation
\frac{(\lambda + 1) \times R \times L \times T}{24 \times C}
```

- {math}`\lambda=` total number of lambda points for the complex simulations; + 1 for the initial equilibration phase (non-FEP)
- {math}`R=` number of replicas
- {math}`L=` number of ligands
- {math}`C=` number of available compute nodes
- {math}`T=` average time (in hours) to complete one FEP production simulation

This formula provides a lower bound for the execution time. In practice, you should account for an additional ± 1 days to accommodate for the remaining tasks, scheduling overheads and runtime variations. Nevertheless, this estimation is usually reliable, as the total time is dominated by the FEP complex simulations. The value of {math}`T` can be determined either from preliminary test runs or by monitoring ongoing simulations

Suppose you plan to run the following:

- {math}`\lambda = 43` (default)
- {math}`R = 3` (default)
- {math}`L = 100`
- {math}`C = 100`
- {math}`T = 1`

Plugging into Eq. {eq}`fep_estimation`:

```{math}
\frac{(43+1) \times 3 \times 100}{100} \times \frac{1}{24} = 5.5 \pm 1 \,\text{days}
```

`````{tab} MMMGBSA

```{math}
:label: mmgbsa_estimation
\frac{(T_E + S \times T_S) \times R \times L}{24 \times C}
```

- {math}`S=` number of samples
- {math}`R=` number of replicas
- {math}`L=` number of ligands
- {math}`C=` number of available compute nodes
- {math}`T_E=` average time (in hours) to complete the production equilibration simulation
- {math}`T_S=` average time (in hours) to complete the sample simulation

This formula provides a lower bound for the execution time. In practice, you should account for an additional ± 0.2 days to accommodate for the remaining tasks, scheduling overheads and runtime variations. Nevertheless, this estimation is usually reliable, as the total time is dominated by the production MD steps. The value of {math}`T_E` and {math}`T_S` can be determined either from preliminary test runs or by monitoring ongoing simulations

````{dropdown} Example Calculation
:color: info

Suppose you plan to run the following:

- {math}`S = 20` (default)
- {math}`R = 3` (default)
- {math}`L = 100`
- {math}`C = 100`
- {math}`T_E = 0.1`
- {math}`T_S = 0.01`

Plugging into Eq. {eq}`mmgbsa_estimation`:

```{math}
\frac{(0.1 + 20 \times 0.01) \times 3 \times 100}{24 \times 100} = 0.04 \pm  0.2 \,\text{days}

## Methodology followed for the estimation of ligand completion time

Task durations were determined based on the estimated GROMACS performance, obtained from a short simulation of the equilibrated structure on an isolated computing node. To avoid startup overhead and performance instability (e.g., due to load balancing), performance counters were restarted after 2000 steps. For non-GROMACS tasks and queuing delays, empirical durations were assigned based on prior experience.

The scheduling algorithm assigns tasks to a fixed number of available computing nodes, considering both task dependencies and a queuing delay to simulate node reconfiguration time. Task execution follows a topological order, ensuring dependency constraints are met. The execution time was computed using a priority queue-based scheduling approach [Abhishek et al. 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-3575-6_33), which minimizes idle time and optimizes resource utilization, similar to standard schedulers such as SLURM [Yoo et al. 2003](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/10968987_3).

In our performance analysis, we evaluated the pipeline’s execution time across varying numbers of ligands and computing nodes. Specifically, we considered ligand counts ranging from 10 to 1000, in increments of 10, and computing nodes ranging from 10 to 200, also in increments of 10. This analysis provides an estimate of the pipeline runtime and scalability under idealized conditions and BindFlow parameters used in this study, serving as a reference for the expected computational cost.

The initial time needed for Snakemake to resolve the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) was not included although it may be relevant as the number of ligands increases.

GROMACS performance was calculated for several systems listed in the next section.

All the scripts to reproduce these results are on [GitHub](https://github.com/ale94mleon/bindflow/tree/main/docs/source/guides/performance/scripts).

## GROMACS benchmark

Reported values are in ns/day (first row of next figure). The node was isolated (SLURM keyword: `exclusive=True`) for the calculation removing the possibility of sharing resources across process. Each job used 10 CPUs and 1 GPU.

## Pipeline completion time

To estimate the completion time, we selected the thrombin system, which achieved a mid-range performance of 270 ns/day for the protein--ligand complex using an Nvidia RTX A4000 GPU and 10 CPU cores of and Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX (second row of previous fgure).

The following figure illustrates the average completion time per ligand as a function of the number of computers (or computing nodes). MMGBSA was approximately 75 times faster than FEP, completing each ligand in under 0.10 hours on average with just 10 computing nodes, demonstrating its computational efficiency. While FEP was more resource-intensive, it scaled efficiently with the number of available computing nodes, achieving an average ligand completion time below the hour with 60 nodes and just 0.29 hours with 200 nodes on the described architecture.

Computational performance and scalability of BindFlow on the Thrombin system. (Upper panel): Estimated average ligand completion time under ideal conditions. Standard deviation is reported (very small). (Lower panel): Estimated rate of ligand completion time between FEP and MMGBSA. Error bars were calculated after uncertainty propagation.

For instance, with **200** nodes running for a week, up to **580** or **39,965** binding free energy calculations could be theoretically performed at FEP or MMGBSA levels, respectively. These estimates assume **ideal conditions** and should be interpreted as preliminary projections of BindFlow’s computational cost.

## Disk use

BindFlow aims to minimize the disk usage during FEP and MM(PB/GB)SA calculations. In addition, after finishing the simulations, BindFlow provides post-processing archiving and unarchiving functionalities to reduce the required medium-term storage.

As a numerical example, for the P38 system that comprised 86376 atoms, calculations with 29 ligands (triplicated calculations) required 320 GB disk space for FEP and 40 GB for MMGBSA during runtime, respectively.

By excluding log files (`.snakemake` directory and `*.log` and `*.err` files) and irrelevant GROMACS files (`.edr`, `mdout.mdp` and `*.tpr`) during archive and compressing all non-trajectory files, the disk space was reduced to 137 GB for FEP and 19 GB for MMGBSA. However, owing to BindFlow full automation, to reproduce the simulations, only the BindFlow version, input structures, run script, and configuration file are required; involving typically only few megabytes for long-term archive.
