## Environment Setup

This code was developed and tested with:
- CUDA 11.8
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 2.0.1

To install the environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate turbohopp
```

## Usage

### Training Consistency Model
```bash
python train_consistency.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Training with RL
For a pretrained consistency model checkpoint:
```bash
python train_rlcm.py  --config configs/config_rlcm_docking.yaml
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate a trained model:
```bash
python evaluate_consistency.py \
    --checkpoint_path path/to/model.ckpt \
    --cuda_device 0 \
    --molecules_per_pocket 10 \
    --find_best \
    --batch_size 512 \
    --mode train \
    --dataset pdbbind_filtered
```
